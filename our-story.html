    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>Hi, I’m the founder of <strong>Lumos Glow</strong>. 🌸</p>
    <p>I started this journey with a simple dream — <strong>100 days, 1 lakh rupees challenge</strong>. It sounded impossible. Every day felt harder, but I refused to give up. I poured my heart into every candle, believing that each flame would carry my story of struggle, hope, and courage.</p>
    <p>This brand isn’t just about candles. It’s about <strong>luxury, love, and persistence</strong>. Every piece is handcrafted, not just to brighten rooms, but to warm souls.</p>
    <p>Today, <strong>Lumos Glow</strong> is more than a candle company. It’s a branded luxury experience ✨. And you, by supporting this dream, are part of my story.</p>
    <p>Thank you for believing in me. Thank you for lighting this journey. 🕯️</p>
